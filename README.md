## ***Ripple*** is a payment protocol, real time payment settlement
platform and remittance network that allows cheap and instantaneous transactions. 
It is owned by *Ripple Labs, Inc.*

---


*  The name of the company is Ripple. While the company wasn't 
officially formed until 2012, the concept was first concieved in 2004 by a 
Canadian Engineer named Ryan Fugger who intended on creating a peer to peer system 
of credits that can be sent back and forth. 

* The company was officially formed in 2012

* Ripple was founded by Jed MCcaleb, Chris Larsen, David Swartz and Arthur Britto.

* The current CEO of Ripple is Brad Garlinghouse.

* The Executive Chairman is Chris Larsen.

* It was originally called "The ripple project" (it was a non profit at the time), then Open Coin. The project was a nonprofit that garnered a lot of respect and attention, but it wasn't making money and couldn't scale the company up.

* The original developers for XRP (the *Cryptocurrency*/native token used for transactions on the Ripple network) were David Schwartz, Arthur Britto and Jed McCaleb. They were originally Bitcoin developers.

* They spotted Bitcoin's flaws early and wanted to create a consensus algorithm that wasn't as detrimental to the environment (Bitcoin consumes a lot of electricity)

* They bought Ryan Fugger's Ripple Project and merged the companies. They created XRP and then gifted the XRP to the new company they just started, Ripple Labs, Inc.

* Ripple has multiple means of funding. It has raised approximately *$300 Million* across two separate funds and 14 funding rounds. Their latest funding round was on August 21, 2021 and it was a Seiers B funding round. *Azure Ventures* are one of thier most recent investors. Japanese powerhouse SBI Investments.

* The problem that Ripple Labs is trying to solve is the multi-billion dollar problem of cross boarder payments and 
cash settlements. They strive to create frictionless exchanges of money between people and institutions.
* The intended *customers* are major institutions (like PNC Bank, Bank of America etc.) and regular civilians. They aim to provide frictionless transactions for major institutions who are moving Billions of dollars, and provide a more efficient alternative for regular civilians, they want to *"Bank the un-Banked"*. 


* The remittance market is one of the biggest markets on the planet. It was valued at *$683 Billion* as of 2018. In 2021 it was estimated that the market has grown to ~*$730 Billion. It is also being projected that by 2026 the market will grow to *~930 Billion*.

* Ripple provides a unique consensus algorithm that makes the *"Byzantine Generals Problem"* irrelavent. They created a minimal (but efficient) trust mechanism and minimal connectivity while still maintaining agreement with the nodes in the network. This is important becuase this allows a low latency consensus algorithm to exist. 
* They also use UNL's (Unique Node List) to prevent "forking of the network" (which is a situatioon where the different sets of nodes reached consensus independently, which will cause the different sets of nodes to observe two different last-closed ledgers).
* "On Demand Liquidity" (formally known as RippleNet, xVia, xCurrent & xRapid) is Ripple Labs' all in on hub that is used to request, send and receive money and settles the transaction(s) within seconds (the outdated technology many legacy banks/institutions are using takes ***days*** to complete this same process on the back end). It is what CEO Brad Garlinghouse referes to as their *"secret sauce"*. On Demand Liquidity leverages XRP to eliminate the need for pre-funding accounts for cross boarder payments.
* xVia replaces the need for FTP servers, which is a server that banks & institutions send files to to start the transaction. It takes the FTP server 3-5 business days to send and verify the transaction with the bank. It can also take months to  setup, as there needs to be a sufficient amount of that countries currency locked up in the bank.
*Upon request from the user who wants to send money can have Ripple's technology withdraw from their digital wallet (while Ripple simultaneously sends an invoice to the user's wallet) and sends it to the recipient. Ripple has countless liquidity partners using their technology, including Singapore based company Tranglo.
* On demand liquidity can seemlessly convert any currency into USD and then into XRP and then into what ever currency the user wants it to be converted in to.

 * The domains that Ripple Labs falls into are Payments, Billing, Cryptocurrency & Blockchain. 

 * Some of the major trends within these domains over the last 5-10 years are providing faster, cheaper payments and creating carbon neutral technology.

*  While Bitcoin & Ethereum still has first movers advantage, many developers see the major flaws in these technologies. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have very high fees. Costing a minimum of $20 per transaction. They also have notoriously slow speed, sometimes taking days for these transactions to be finalized. 

* Bitcoin and Ethereum also have been under heavy scrutiny for the amount of electricity that is necessary to mine Bitcoin & Ethereum and to verify their transactions. The Whitehouse is estimating that Bitcoin and Ethereum mining causes at least 30 Million metric tons of carbon dioxide to be released on a yearly basis. 
Which is about 0.3% of the global greenhouse gas emissions. 

* Some of the major competitors of Ripple in these domains are the SWIFT Banking System, Stellar Lumens (XLM), MoneyGram & Western Union.

* As of 2019 Ripple has secured over 300 customers who are using Ripple Net for payments. Some of the companies Ripple has partnered with include PNC Treasury Management, Tranglo and Japanese based company SBI. 

* MoneyMatch has reported that their cost for cross-boarder payments has decreased by 40% since joining RippleNet. 

* Sentbe customers have saved over $25 Million in transaction fees. 

* Ripple is expanding in Dubai, as 20% of their customers are in MENA. 
* When announcing Ripple expanding to Dubai, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said on Twitter:

>" As I just shared on stage at #DubaiFintechSummit, 
@Ripple is expanding in Dubai. With 20% of our customers based in MENA and clear regulatory regimes being developed, it’s no surprise that Dubai is emerging as a key global financial hub for crypto innovation to thrive.”



* In 2021 the ***World Economic Forum*** acknowledged the XRP Ledger (XRPL) as one of the prime examples of a scalable cryptocurrency project in their guide that serves as a starter's guide into the potential of Cryptocurrency.

*   A service that I would reccomend that Ripple Labs look into is music streaming. 
Streaming platforms like Spotify are generating over $12 Billion as of 2022. A major issue is no platform that can provide a faster, cheaper payment mechanism to artist that would allow them to instantamiously have money transfered into their bank account after their content is streamed. Right now, platforms like Payoneer are the go-to option for music distrution platforms like TuneCore. That platforms severely slows down the process of recieving compensation for your art. Receiving payment as fast as possible is paramount for independent artist as many of them are not making a lot of money in the first place, so they can't afford to wait weeks and months on end to receive the pay-out they are owed. A platform that can allow instant payment from the streams your content is getting would allow more artist to supplement the income generated from their day jobs and would allow them to have the flexibility to 
fully pursue music once they get to the point where it has become a reliable source of income for them.
